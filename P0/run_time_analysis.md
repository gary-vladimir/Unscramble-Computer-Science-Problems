# Time Complexity Analysis for "Unscramble Computer Science Problems"

## Task - 0

he script correctly prints out the information of first record of texts and last record of calls.

`O(1)`

The operations are not dependent on iteration, and the access time for items in a list will take a constant time.

## Task - 1

The script correctly prints number of distinct telephone numbers in the dataset.

`O(n+logn)`

one iteration loop and another nested logarithmic loop

## Task - 2

The script correctly prints the telephone number that spent the longest time on the phone and the total time in seconds they spend on phone call.

`O(n)`

Only 1 iteration loop used

## Task - 3

The script correctly prints the telephone codes called by fixed-line numbers in Bangalore and the percentage of calls from fixed lines in Bangalore that are to fixed lines in Bangalore.

`O(n)`

Two iteration loops used separately

## Task - 4

The script correctly prints the list of numbers that could be telemarketers.

`O(n)`

Four loops iterating separately
